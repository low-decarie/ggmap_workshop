Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.
Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally sponge
dominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastrea
faveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  At
deeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only of
particular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  The
water temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggers
recording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C.
 Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer lived
and slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas and
Siderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities and
Madracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed.
 M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,
sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.

Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've been
able to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleaching
along the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.

Both A. palmata and A. cervicornis showed signs of the bleaching, but no other species seemed to be affected.  The observations were taken in three different locations within the atoll's lagoon (no observations taken on the fore reef) during repeated benthic transects.  That genus is already found in low numbers within Glovers due to its slow recovery after Hurricane Mitch in '98 and various other bleaching events.  In an odd twist, I did some work at the Brooklyn Aquarium (WCS) in the coral culture lab in May and noted bleaching
among our Acropora samples just before I left.  Even samples in SEPARATE tanks were showing the same bleaching trends.  Not sure if there is a correlation, but an interesting observation none the less.","Brie Cokos [bcokos@wcs.org] in coral list 25/8/2004",NA,"BLZ"

although shaded colonies under overhangs, etc remain brown & not visibly 
affected.  At the same time occasional bleached plating Agaricia colonies were 
also visible on the fore-reef.  Also at the beginning of September, a few 
Montastraea annularis colonies showed signs of paling - this situation has 
worsened, and now more M. annularis colonies are showing signs of paling, at 
least at two locations on the Eastern side of the Atoll (Middle Caye and Long

maybe as much as 80% (V. approximate guesstimate) of colonies showing visible paling, whereas at Long Caye this figure might be around 20 %.  However, at both sites no bright white M. annularis colonies have been seen.

Coral patches cover an area of 3876.2 m2. In 2003 a small jetty was constructed between the sea and the Juluapan lagoon adjacent to the north-west margin of the reef.
This zone is constantly exposed to increases of temperature influenced by the diurnal contributions from the Juluapan Lagoon, from which influxes of water at 27,5 and 32.0 °C in winter and summer, respectively.
During the summer of 2004 (AprilJune) diving campaigns were undertaken to study the bleaching phenomenon in this zone.  Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.
The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reef's productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.","Ms Angelica Flores Ramirez,  Universidad de Colima.",NA,"MEX"

Our first observations of pale corals was done in May in Akumal reef, with 7% of the colonies showing pale coloration at a depth of 10-15m. By June, 9% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Mahahual Reef at the same depth. By July, 32% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Punta Allen reef.

At present, (August-September) surveys at Puerto Morelos reef show that 41% of the colonies were bleached and 31% of them were completely white.
Surveys were done at a depth of 4-8m.

The number of colonies sampled at each site was over 2000. Almost all scleractinian species showed bleaching signs, as well as some gorgonians, Milleporas and zoanthids.","MC. Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez

The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.

The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.","John Rollino [John.Rollino@earthtech.com] in Coral list 12/1/2005",NA,"BHS"

Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the project's last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.

Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.

Water temps. Have been above 29 Celcius since June (Hobo data). I will be conducting disease surveys in mid-November, so if anything like what we saw in 2005 with WPD and YBD outbreaks during and after the massive bleaching occurs here, we will probably have a chance to document this in our permanent survey transects around the island.

On the other hand, here in Puerto Rico, there are no signs of a bleaching event. Just the usual, a few pale colonies here and there. Same situation observed during our disease surveys last week in Grenada.","Observer: Croy McCoy

In the area, lobster fishing with compressors is supposedly illegal but this is not enforced. Most of the fishermen use air compressors to dive on the reefs. This is a popular site for lobster fishing and spear gun fishing on the reefs. Fishermen drop anchors on reef - could benefit from buoys.","Reef Check submitted by Darien Clary.

The area has been sampled using REEFCHECK to contain between 16% and 21% live coral. <br>
Bleaching observed within shallow lagoon areas (<3M depth) behind reef and areas likely influenced by warm lagoon waters.<br>
This bleaching event is not as yet particularly intensive. It will be observed for change in the coming weeks.<br>
Water temperature was measured by Citizen wrist-mounted digital thermometer to be 31 degrees Celsius.<br>
Level and prominence of bleaching observed as follows:<br>
Millepora spp. (mainly complanata): Bleaching occurring in less then 50% of colonies. Bleaching intensity strong in less then 25% of cases.<br>
Montastrea annularis: Bleaching occurring in less then 20% of colonies. No colonies larger then 30cm diameter affected. Bleaching rarely (<10 of cases) more intense then simple fading of colour from uppermost area.<br>
Acropora cervicornis: Bleaching occurring on 70% of colonies observed; patchy, and mainly on upper surfaces of branch. Larger colonies (30CM diameter) more likely to be affected then small colonies and single branches. Bleaching accompanied by white band disease in four colonies. (A. cervicornis is relatively rare. <20 colonies observed total). <br>
Agaricia agaricites: Bleaching observed on colony ridges, patchy. Less then 20 individuals observed displaying notable bleaching in this locally common species.  <br>
Porites porites: Bleaching observed as fading of colour on upper faces of branches and growth tips in four colonies, all of the brown morph. This species and morph is common.<br>

I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Martín de Pajarales Island (10°10'37.7""N-75°46'16.2""). Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).<br>
Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>

It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report. <br> 
No sponges had bleached. Even brown encrusting Cliona, which harbor zooxanthellae, were fine. <br>

shallow waters (<10m) at Bahía de Nenguange on the 21st of October. A week later, most M. annularis colonies were bleached, showing the classic
bleaching pattern being more intense on top than on the sides, while
Colpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November the
bleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularis
and Porites porites were severely bleached, while most M. faveolata,
Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides,
Siderastrea siderea, Millepora spp., and the zoanthid Palythoa

coral reefs of Bahía de Taganga, adjacent to the TNNP, however, most P.
astreoides colonies were severely bleached in Taganga, in contrast to
Bahia de Neguange. <br>

It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite late
compared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs at
Islas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 months
earlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. This
might have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs in
the area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and by
July-August. <br>

Díaz et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>

Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was
30 °C. <br>
By the end of October, SST was also 30 °C but we found that 21 ± 4% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: <br>
M. franksi (50%)<br>
M. faveolata (31%)<br>
C. natans (15%)<br>
M. meandrites (100%)<br>
A. agaricites (67%) <br>
hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).<br>
Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.<br>

By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 °C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. <br>

We will keep monitoring this event and hope to report the recovery of the colonies in the next weeks.<br>","Sebastian Rodriguez [sebastianr@usb.ve] in Coral list 11/24/2005",NA,"VEN"

Cheeca Rocks is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. <br>
Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 266 corals at Cheeca Rocks have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>
On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 19% of the monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>
On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 74% of monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 11% at Cheeca Rocks.  <br>
Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian corals observed to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata, Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians. The only notable exception was individuals of Mycetophyllia spp. which appeared healthy and experienced no noticeable bleaching.<br>
Water temperature was recorded during each site visit with a YSI-30 at
depths of 1 meter and 5 meters from the surface.  Water temperatures in

Coral Gardens is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 350 corals at Coral Gardens have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>
On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 33% of the monitored corals at Coral Gardens.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>
On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 80% of monitored corals at Coral Gardens were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 15% at Coral Gardens.  Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian corals
observed to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata,
Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians. The only notable exception was individuals of Mycetophyllia spp. which appeared healthy and experienced no noticeable bleaching.<br>
In addition, three new Black-band diseases had begun affecting 100% bleached colonies of C. natans at Coral Gardens <br>
Water temperature was recorded during each site visit with a YSI-30 at
depths of 1 meter and 5 meters from the surface.  Water temperatures in
degrees Celsius were recorded as follows:

Other:  We do not know when the bleaching started or ended. We surveyed everyday 16-20 October, 200, and it appeared that we were catching the tail end of a minor bleaching event. The water was warm. NOAA reported elevated degree heating weeks in september 200

Additional Notes on site, locators, buoys, benchmarks or landmarks: Dry Tortugas National Park. We sampled 9 sites inside the new no-take Research Natural Area, and 9 sites outside the RNA but still in the park. We only sampled in this depth stratum from 2 to 4 m, so we do not know if corals outside this depth range bleach.


Affected species:
Agaricia	   agaricites	 (10	0% bleached), Porites	 astreoides	  (3	0% bleached),  Diploria	 clivosa	 (5	0% bleached), Briareum	  asbestinum	      (5	0% bleached), Palythoa	  caribbaeorum	  10	0% bleached

Comments on affected species: These are all species known to be sensitive to bleaching. These are qualitative data. We did do transects, but the % cover of coral was low itself, and the % bleached was so low that we only detected the bleaching by seeing the occasional colony here an

Other Comments: Bleaching of at least one of these species was observed at 11 of the 18 sites we surveyed. Other species observed bleaching include Montastrea cavernosa, Porites porites, and Diploria labyrinthiformis","Dr. Ilsa Kuffner, Coral Reef Ecologist, US Geological Survey

A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface.

During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US Virgin
Islands, we've noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend to
normal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This has
happened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least some
light color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale to
full normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color more
rapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60
ft (4.6-8.3 m).<br>

The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site at
Tektite Reef went from 30.4º C (86.7º F) in September to 29.6º C (85.3º F)
in October.<br>

October was a very rainy and cloudy month.  During the period 9/30 -
10/11, 11.04 inches (28 cm) of rain were recorded while the seawater
temperature at a monitoring site (depth 55 ft/16.8 m) dropped 1.6 ºC (~3
ºF). <br>

But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future. 
We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""
We think the hard coral in this area will become good to 2004 level in next year if it will be not so cold, no typhoon and no eaten trace by shells or COTS, because the tabler type hard coral recover well. But we need to remember many coral died in 2004-2005 winter and it necessary for 4 years to recover it.

We didn't find bleaching hard coral, but we found some disease tabler Acropora neaer the transect line, they maybe ""white syndrome."" We could not find any major change at fish and invertebrate survey. We think the major reason of HC and SC percentage decrease was the bleaching in last summer, like 3m transect, but the damage at 6m transect was less then 3m, because the depth protect from the stress by high water temperature and ultraviolet rays.

In this Yaeyama area, coral reef got huge damage by bleaching, typhoon and crown of thorns, from summer of 2007 till winter. But this survey show the damage at northern reef of Yaeyama area was comparatively little. We need continuous survey at good condition area like here to protect Yaeyama area.","Reef Check, Submitted by Megumu Tsuchikawa. Site ID : 123.58.33.95E.24.22.2.86N",NA,"JPN"

Species affected and Level of bleaching<br>
Leptoria phrygia - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>

Pocillopora damicornis - Some branch tips only<br>
Acropora muricata (formally A. formosa) - 2 small colonies totally bleached<br>
Montipora foliosa - Edges of whorls bleached<br>
In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>
In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>
Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.
Minor coral bleaching was reported from SL last year too, from Trincomalee in the East coast and Rumassala reef in the south.","Rajasuriya, A. 2005.  	Coral Bleaching in the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary Observed on 26th March 2005 Sri Lanka. CORDIO online document",24247,"LKA"

significant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.

than 5% bleaching recorded in areas that were up to 90% bleached in 1998. It appears that
recovery of healthy corals at deeper sites was significant. For example at convention 18m,
the recovery was from <10% live tissue growth from over 45% living cover, to over 25%
tissue with zooxanthellae. This represents an increase in coral tissue with
zooxanthellae of over 150% six months after the bleaching was recorded.
At Hilarys Reef, the coral at 18m was left with <10% cover with zooxanthellae after
the bleaching event in August, but recovered to over 20% (another 100%+ recovery rate) in
6 months. Pavona clavus tissue at Hilarys Reef showed considerable recovery of
zooxanthellae, with many of the colonies becoming pigmented at medium (12m) depths six
months after August. Here, healthy corals significantly changed from a
cover of less than 5% in September 1998 to over 60% by August 2000. This 55% increase in
healthy coral tissue was related to existing P. clavus colonies regaining their zooxanthellae..
What was encouraging was the recovery of live coral one year after the bleaching
event. At Hilarys Reef 18m (5 to 23%), Convention 12m (5 to 18%), Convention
18m (3 to 30%) there were all rises in the population of healthy (pigmented) coral tissue.
These changes were not statistically significant, but were important trends at deeper depths
that showed positive change in coral percent cover for these areas. Bleached coral
populations fell considerably over the first year of observations.
At Convention reef, diverse coral forms such as Porites cylindrica, Sarcophyton spp.
and bottlebrush Acropora spp. were all damaged, with at least over 50% of their tissue
bleached. The branching coral Pocillopora damicornis was observed in three
quadrats in two different locations, and appeared not to have beached as readily as other
Acropora sp. branching and digitate life-forms.","1 m2 quadrat, with photographics and insitu observation","","31C","","Bleaching occurred over  August and September 1998. Corals were affected to a depth of 18m. Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. 
Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.).

The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)

Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached. 
Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.
Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper 
slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat. 
Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by 
A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.
Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon. 
A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.
Bleaching of other corals was rare. 
Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which 
was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was 
minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. 
Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were 
recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were 
reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in 
bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).

The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks 
- perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added 
insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis 
indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal being
completely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the 
reef crest - most sites are bleached to about 20-30% down to 10 m.  
Bleaching is noticeably greater closer to Gladstone (seen from the 
air as your fly by Heli to Gladstone) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 20/3/2002)","Hoegh-Guldberg, O., R. Johnstone and  S. Dove

As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>
Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>
For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>
Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    
In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.","Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005",NA,"ASM"

This is true of the places with open circulation as well as the closed circulation areas.",NA,"","","",">30C","","A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.
     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.
    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.

Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.","Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.",NA,"ASM"

This led to some bleaching at a national scale, principally of the genus Acropora corals, but only in shallow waters. Shallow areas (2-4m) in which the CCC Fiji data is derived showed 5 % of coral colonies of the genus Acropora having been bleached. There was also one large area of Acropora coral at 14 m near Sunflower reef where a 15 m2 area was bleached, but only the apical portions of the colonys branches. Other than this small percent of bleached coral and the deeper bleaching at Sunflower, there appeared to be little overall impact of the bleaching in the Mamanucas for April-May 2002. Bleaching in 2002 was not nearly as significant as the bleaching event that occurred in 2000.","Walker, D., J.L. Solandt, S. Haycock, J. Taylor, S. Harding and P. Raines, 2002

equally distributed in branching and tabulate acroporas. A little less

Styllophora sp.), while Agariciidae, Faviidae and Mussidae < 10%.  
Bleaching was particularly dominant over the reef crest and slope 
habitats though, average 50% bleaching was recorded in low 
coverage of acropora colonies at the lagoon floor.

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug
1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  
The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.
Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","Jokiel, P.L. personal communication to  NOAA & ReefBase (18/7/2003)",NA,"USA_HAW"
